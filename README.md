NSDate+HumanInterval
====================

An Objective-C category that adds a single method to `NSDate`:
`-humanIntervalSinceNow`. This method returns an `NSString` with a
human-readable (English, Spanish) representation of the `NSDate`, relative to now. The
default values are short, for use on the iPhone. Some examples:

* "just now": Less than 30 seconds ago.
* "n secs": Less than a minute ago.
* "n mins": Less than 45 minutes ago.
* "1 hour": Between 45 and 90 minutes ago.
* "2 hours": Between 90 minutes and three hours ago.
* "n hours": Less than 23 hours ago.
* "1 day": Between 23 and 36 hours ago.
* "2 days": Between 36 and 72 hours ago.
* "n days": Less than 7 days ago.
* "1 week": Less than 11 days ago.
* "2 weeks": Between 11 and 14 days ago.
* "n weeks": Less than 9 weeks ago.
* "n months": Less than 19 months ago.
* "1 year": Less than 2 years ago.
* "n years": Over two years.

Could probably use some tweaking, and definitely localization, but hopefully
it's useful. To use it, reference `src/NSDate+HumanInterval.h` and
`src/NSDate+HumanInterval.m` in your Xcode project, then add:

    #import "NSDate+HumanInterval.h"

Then just call `humanIntervalSinceNow` on an `NSDate` object:

    NSString *reltime = [self.buzzer.when humanIntervalSinceNow];

If you'd like to run the unit tests, open `NSDate+HumanInterval.xcodeproj` in
Xcode and build the "UnitTesting" target.
